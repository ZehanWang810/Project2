# Project 2: React Application with Firestore

## Overview
This project implements a React application with modular components and Firestore integration for persistent storage. While the core functionality is implemented, there is a known UI bug that appears after initial page load.

## Part 1: Design Documentation
The complete design documentation including mockups and module diagrams can be found in:
[Project2-ZehanWang.pdf](Project2-ZehanWang.pdf)

## Part 2: Implementation

### Implemented Features
- ✅ Modular architecture with component-based design
- ✅ React implementation using functional components and Hooks
- ✅ Frontend persistent storage using Firestore
- ✅ Successful deployment (hosted on Firestore)

### Known Issues
- There is a UI rendering bug that occurs after the initial page load. The exact cause is still under investigation.

### Technical Approach
1. **Modularization**: The application was built using separate functional components
2. **State Management**: React hooks (useState, useEffect) were used throughout
3. **Persistence**: Data is stored in Firestore without backend implementation
4. **Deployment**: The application is deployed using Firestore hosting

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start development server: `npm start`

## Future Improvements
- Resolve the post-load UI bug
- Add form validation
- Implement additional error handling
- Enhance the user interface

## Submission Notes
I apologize for the late submission and for not fully meeting all project requirements. I've worked to implement the core functionality but recognize there are areas needing improvement, particularly with the UI bug. I appreciate your understanding and any feedback you can provide to help me improve.s/troubleshooting#npm-run-build-fails-to-minify)
